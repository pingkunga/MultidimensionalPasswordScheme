# Multidimensional Password Scheme

Abstract

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nowadays accessing information is performed via web based applications because of
the convenience, ease and speed of the Internet. However there is a lack of security in terms of
authentication because most web applications use easily circumvented textual passwords to
identify a user. The purpose of this project is to present a method of authentication with
Multidimensional Password Scheme in 3D environment. We have developed a system
prototype of authentication powered by HTML5 and WebGL. The results of our experiment
show that the system prototype can be run on Mozilla FireFox and Google Chrome with the
score 54 and 52 respectively, the password space increases about 1.29 times over that of
traditional textual passwords. We also have evaluated this prototype using an SQL Injection
method to test its security and it passes all tests. According to the result of the study with this
system carried out computer science students, we found that the students can easily use the
authentication system and are satisfied with this approach about 73 percent.
